Created a Tableau Dashboard about Disney+ Movies &amp; TV Shows.

Hello all, Welcome to my Github. 

This is my first Tableau dashboard project that I completed, though, it was with the assistance of a YT tutorial. (YT: DataScience RoadMap)

This dashboard gives some general information about the Disney+ platform, and the amounts of movies and TV shows they upload on their platform, including the ratings and genre.
